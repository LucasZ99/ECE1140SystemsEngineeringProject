Inputs
name - what we do w/ it - dtype - example - units

    Track Controller:
        Commanded Speed - just passing - float - 50, m/s
        Authority - just passing - float - 100, m
        Switch Position - updates switch positions - [int, bool] - [5, True] - Block ID, Left/Right
        Signal Activation - updates signal positions - [int, bool] - [5, True] - Block ID, Green/Red
        Rail Road Crossing - updates rail-road positions - [int, bool] - [5, True], Idle/Active
    Train Model:
        Train Spawned - create a new train instance at first block - bool - True - is a train being spawned in at this time
        Train Presence Changed - updates block occupancy - int - 1 - number of blocks moved since last time it was sent
        Disembarking Passengers - updates disembarking passengers @ station - [int, int] - [11, 52] - Station Block ID, Num Passengers Disembarking



Outputs
name - where we get it - dtype - example - units

    Track Controller:
        Block Occupancy - stored in layout data, calculated from 'Train Presence Changed' and 'Train Spawned'
        Track Information - track layout data for section wayside controls - numpy array - [...] - units vary
    Train Model:
        Commanded Speed - from track controller input - float - 50, m/s
        Authority - from track controller input - float - 100, m
        Beacon - track layout data @ index of block train is occupying - string - any 128 char msg
        Limits - track layout data @ index of block train is occupying - int - 70 - km/h
        Grade - track layout data @ index of block train is occupying - int - 10 - %
        Elevation - track layout data @ index of block train is occupying - float - 1.5 - cumulative m
        Underground - track layout data @ index of block train is occupying - bool - False - underground/above-ground
    CTC:
        Ticket Sales - randomly generated reasonable number - int - 524 - number of ticket sales total

MISC
    Embarking - random portion of ticket sales
    Block Occupancy from train presence - We only know when trains are dispatched from yard and when trains move to next block
